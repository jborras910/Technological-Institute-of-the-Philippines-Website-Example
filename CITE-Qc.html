                        <h4>Outcomes-Based Education</h4>
                        <h5>OUTCOMES-BASED EDUCATION (OBE)</h5>
                        <p>The T.I.P. Implementation of outcomes-based education was driven by the following external entities: 1) Regulatory bodies such as the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC), International
                            Maritime Organization (IMO), among others, 2) Local and international accrediting bodies, specifically, the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA), the Philippine Technological
                            Council-Accreditation and Certification Board for Engineering and Technology - Engineering Accreditation Commission (PTC - ACBET - EAC), and ABET, Inc., 3) International certifying bodies, and 4) Feedback from other external
                            constituents.
                        </p>
                        <p>It is also guided by existing T.I.P. internal policies and initiatives: 1) The T.I.P. Vision, Mission, Core Values, and Core Competencies, 2) T.I.P. Quality Policy, and 3) Other T.I.P. initiatives that supported the OBE implementation
                            such as a) the T.I.P. Faculty and Staff Development Program, and b) The T.I.P. Student Development Program.</p>
                        <p>The institutional outcome statement was formulated based on the T.I.P. graduates attributes. Outcomes at the program level and course level were also formulated aligned with institutional outcomes.</p>
                        <p>The framework which T.I.P. adopted in its OBTL implementation revolves around three important elements: 1) Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs), 2) Teaching and Learning Activities (TLAs) and 3) Assessment Tasks (ATs).
                        </p>
                        <p>In support of T.I.P.’s outcomes-based education and as a strategy to promote academic excellence, T.I.P. has also embarked on a proactive plan to implement outcomes-based teaching and learning or OBTL in all its academic programs
                            using the City University of Hong Kong OBTL model.</p>
                        <p>The OBE process is also supported by facilities, management processes and procedures resources and support structures sub-systems.</p>
                        <p>The results of the assessment and evaluation are used as inputs in the continual improvement of the instructional process specifically on the constructive alignment of ILOs, TLAs, and ATs.</p>
                        <p>It is expected that the implementation of OBTL as part of T.I.P.’s OBE would hasten the realization of T.I.P.’s mission "to transform students into graduates with full competence in their fields of study and who also possess Filipino
                            values, industry-desired values, and global citizen values”.</p>

                        <ul>

                        <p>In recent years, T.I.P. had the privilege to receive international and national recognitions for providing quality education to students. The said recognitions are the following:</p>
                        <p>ISO Certification. T.I.P.’s quality management system is certified to ISO 9001:2015 by Det Norske Veritas – Germanischer Lloyd (DNV-GL) in the provision of all its academic offerings.</p>
                        <p>This helps ensure that all training and education services consistently meet all customer and applicable statutory, regulatory and accreditation requirements. This also helps address customer satisfaction through the effective
                            and efficient application of the system, continual improvement, and the prevention of nonconformity. T.I.P. is one among a select number of schools in the Philippines which went into ISO certification as early as 19 years ago.
                            To date, it continues to maintain its ISO certification.</p>
                        <p>Some of the notable components of T.I.P.’s QMS are: a) 5S, a Japanese-inspired good housekeeping program, and b) KAIZEN, a continuous small-steps improvement program.</p>
                        <p>There can be no clearer confirmation of effective quality management than the distinction of being benchmarked by one’s peers. Through the years, the institution has hosted several benchmarking visits by presidents, officers, faculty
                            and staff of other institutions of higher learning, and other organizations, bringing to fore its modest contribution to the sharing of effective policies and practices. To date, forty eight (48) local institutions and organizations
                            have benchmarked with T.I.P. Schools from Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Cambodia have also benchmarked with the institution.</p>
                        <p>Autonomous Status. On May 16, 2016, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) awarded T.I.P. Quezon City with Autonomous Status. Autonomous status is the highest possible award given by CHED to a higher education institution in
                            recognition of its exemplary performance shown in the provision of quality instruction, research and extension work.</p>
                        <p>Center of Excellence. T.I.P. Quezon City was recognized as a CHED Center of Excellence (COE) in Information Technology Education which includes the programs: Computer Science, Information Systems and Information Technology.</p>
                        <p>Levels of Accreditation. T.I.P. Quezon City has various accreditation levels for its different program offerings under the Federation of Accrediting Agencies of the Philippines-Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities
                            Commission on Accreditation (FAAP-PACUCOA). T.I.P. Quezon City received Level IV Accredited Status in Information Technology, Computer Science and Information Systems.</p>
