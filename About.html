                            <h5>History</h5>
                            <img src="about-img/oldbuiding.jpg" class="history-img">
                            <p>On February 8, 1962, a group of educators headed by Engineer Demetrio A. Quirino Jr. and Dr. Teresita U. Quirino established the TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF THE PHILIPPINES as a private non-sectarian stock school.</p>
                            <p>T.I.P. laid down its objectives based on the vision of its founders: 1) to maintain a high standard of instruction; 2) to bring within the reach of the masses the blessings of higher education; and 3) to cooperate with the
                                government in the implementation of its economic and social amelioration programs. The School had an initial enrollment of 2,400 which steadily increased.</p>
                            <p>T.I.P. then directed itself toward specialization in the field of technology. In 1977, it offered a two-year associate course in Marine Engineering. In 1980, the Liberal Arts, Education and high school programs were phased
                                out to make way for the school’s new thrust. In 1981, the student population already exceeded 23,000.</p>
                            <p>T.I.P. opened its Quezon City campus in 1983 located at 20th Avenue, Cubao. T.I.P.QC through the years acquired adjacent properties including a frontage along Aurora Boulevard. The Quezon City campus has ten (10) main buildings
                                spread out in the 3.3-hectare site.</p>

                                building. The Arlegui Campus, on the other hand, also has a six-storey building.</p>

                                with Filipino values, industry and global citizen values. An institution that transforms students into graduates who will contribute to the general welfare of society.</p>

                                Maritime Organization (IMO), among others, 2) Local and international accrediting bodies, specifically, the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA), the Philippine Technological

                                such as a) the T.I.P. Faculty and Staff Development Program, and b) The T.I.P. Student Development Program.</p>
                            <p>The institutional outcome statement was formulated based on the T.I.P. graduates attributes. Outcomes at the program level and course level were also formulated aligned with institutional outcomes.</p>
                            <p>The framework which T.I.P. adopted in its OBTL implementation revolves around three important elements: 1) Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs), 2) Teaching and Learning Activities (TLAs) and 3) Assessment Tasks (ATs).</p>

                            <p>In support of T.I.P.’s outcomes-based education and as a strategy to promote academic excellence, T.I.P. has also embarked on a proactive plan to implement outcomes-based teaching and learning or OBTL in all its academic programs
                                using the City University of Hong Kong OBTL model.</p>
