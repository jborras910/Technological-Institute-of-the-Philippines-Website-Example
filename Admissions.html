                        <p>As a general rule, any student who wishes to discontinue his studies during the semester must notify in writing the Registrar, through the Head of Students Affairs/Department Chair, and copy furnish the Student Accounting Section
                            Head. The parents or guardian of the student must note the letter if the student is a minor. Failure to submit the letter is tantamount to forfeiture of the student's rights to any refund of fees.</p>
                        <p>A student who registers his withdrawal within two weeks after the beginning of classes and who has fully paid the pertinent fees may apply for a refund. With his application for refund stamped and received by the Student Accounting
                            Section within the same week, the student will be charged as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ten percent (10%) of the total amount due for the term if he withdraws within the first week of classes whether he has attended classes or not.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Because of the heavy workload during the registration period, the Student Accounting Section can accommodate refund claims usually one month after registration.</p>
